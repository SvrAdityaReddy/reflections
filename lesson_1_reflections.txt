How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Helped me to debug code in shorter time

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    This can help me to go through the older versions if required sometimes we 
    might need to refer older version of code and also helps me to find bug.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    In Google docs we cannot have prevous versions of file offline.
    In Git we need to create commits manually whenever there is a logical change.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because some files can dependent over each other and also to track across
    multiple files within a same repository.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log --stat
    git diff commitid1 commitid2

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Checkout can help me to know from which commit i have introduced the error.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Will use it for collaborative projects and use it as a tool for version
    control.
