When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When we are using others system.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because it might unneccessarily checking for pulling a request.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are used when we are cloning a repository from github to github.
    Clones are used when we are downloading a repository.
    Branches can be used for collaboration and also for adding new ideas.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So that they can be merged easily.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    We should collaborate together i.e they should be near by but if there 
    are many members it will be difficult to collaborate. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    If we had already had a running code if we add some thing new we will create
    a branch othen we will pull a request and merge later.
